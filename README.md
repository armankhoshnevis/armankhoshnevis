## About ME 

Hi 👋!

- 👨‍🎓 My name is Arman and I am currently a second-year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Michigan State University
- 🧑‍💻 As a graduate reseach assistance, my research spans wide range of topics from developing fractional-order constitutive models for nano-composites and study them from statistical perspective to the studying the effect of anxiety on voice.
- 🌩 I am very new to Git and GitHub! However, I am very determined to stay in touch with it and upload my projects (including my reseach and course projects in ML, Data Science, etc.) here.
